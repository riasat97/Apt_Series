A pointer is a variable which stores the address of another variable.
it points to an address of a value.

Pointer acts as references to different types of objects such as variables, arrays, functions, structures, etc. However, C language does not have the concept of references as in C++. 
Therefore, in C we use the pointer as a reference.
Pointers are the instruments of dynamic memory Management. It is helpful in allocation and de-allocation of memory during the execution of the program.

To return multiple values from function using pointer.//like passing arrays/strings in function
Pointer enables us to access variables that are declared outside the functions 

Pointers enhance the execution speed of a program.
It reduces the code length and improves the performance.

Storage of strings through pointers saves memory space.
Pointers may be used to pass on arrays, strings, functions,structures and variables as arguments of a function.
Pointers are helpful in traversing through arrays and character strings.
